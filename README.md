# AI Chat Application

## Overview

This repository contains a full-stack AI-powered chat application built with the following components:

- **Backend:** Python FastAPI server that handles API requests and integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
- **Frontend:** A simple HTML and JavaScript-based user interface for interacting with the chat application.
- **Utilities:** Shell scripts and Python scripts for managing server processes and combining text data.

The project demonstrates seamless integration of AI capabilities into a modern web application.

## Project Structure

### File Descriptions

- `server.py`: The FastAPI server implementation, providing a `/chat/` endpoint to process user input and return AI responses.
- `index.html`: The main frontend file providing a user interface for the chat application.
- `script.js`: Handles user interactions on the frontend and communicates with the backend API.
- `start_server.sh`: A shell script to kill any process running on port 8000 and restart the FastAPI server.
- `combiner.py`: Utility script to combine content from all files in the current directory into a single text file.
- `test_transformers.py`: A standalone script showcasing text generation using the Hugging Face GPT-2 model.
- `.DS_Store`: Automatically generated system file (ignored in most cases).
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `combined_output.txt`: Output file generated by `combiner.py` containing combined content from all files.

## Prerequisites

### Backend Requirements

- Python 3.8+

#### Required Python packages:

- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`
- `pydantic`
- `openai`
- `transformers`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Requirements

- A modern web browser.

## Running the Application

### Backend Setup

1. **Set OpenAI API Key:**
   Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your shell. Example:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   Use the provided shell script to start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   ./start_server.sh
   ```

   The server will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

### Frontend Setup

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Interact with the application by typing messages and viewing AI responses.

## Additional Utilities

### Combine Files Script

The `combiner.py` script reads all files in the current directory, extracts their content, and saves it in `combined_output.txt`. Run it using:

```bash
python combiner.py
```

### Test Transformers Script

The `test_transformers.py` script demonstrates text generation using Hugging Face GPT-2. Execute it as:

```bash
python test_transformers.py
```

## Deployment Notes

Ensure the server is running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) for the frontend to function.

For production, consider deploying using services like AWS, GCP, or Azure and securing API keys and endpoints.
